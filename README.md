In this notebook you'll learn how to use Pytorch for building neural network and perform deep learning with Pytorch
# What is Pytorch

PyTorch is a library for Python programs that facilitates building deep learning projects
PyTorch supports dynamic computational graphs, which means the network behavior can be changed programmatically at runtime. This facilitates more efficient model optimization and gives PyTorch a major advantage over other machine learning frameworks, which treat neural networks as static objects.
If you want to explore Deep learning then Pytorch is your friend
